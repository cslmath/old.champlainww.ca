<h3>If you cannot log in to WeBWorK</h3>

<ul>
<li> Are you accessing the correct course? 
   <ul>
   <li> Check the course name. For example, Calculus 1 Science courses begin with 201-NYA, whereas Calculus 1 Social Science (Commerce) courses begin with 201-103. Linear Algebra Science courses begin with 201-NYC, whereas Linear Algebra Social Science courses begin with 201-105.
   <li> Check your teacher's name. All courses have the teacher name at the end.
   <li> Your teacher might have more than one course, or more than one section of the same course. 
   </ul>
<li> Are you using the correct password?
   <ul>
   <li> Your WeBWorK password is different from the password given to you by the College.
   <li> Your initial WeBWorK password is the same as your student ID.
   <li> Even if you used WeBWorK in the past, your WeBWorK password gets reset at the beginning of every semester and for every course.
   </ul>
</ul>
If you still cannot log in, talk to your teacher. If needed, your teacher can reset your password for you.
